## Notes: Keynotes

### Lightning talks
- Keynote 1
  - new data initiative: Confidential Computing Consortium
    - confidential computing = security + privacy
    - focus on encrypting data in transit, at rest, *and in use*
    - idea is that, if you need to manipulate data, you manipulate the *encrypted* data
    - recently, the healthcare field is trying to do this
    - data privacy practices pledge (https://datapractices.org/)
  - new open hardware initiative: OpenPOWER
- Keynote: infrastructure matters, by [Cheryl Huang](oicheryl.com)
  - data centers emit as much CO_2 as an airline; as a country, only surpassed by the US & China
  - Spotify: fixed their CPU until it improved 2-3x
  - city of Montreal: had 100s of VMs; reduced it to 8 machines
  - since global internet traffic = 75 TB/sec, any changes the industry makes will have a huge impact
- Keynote: calling all doc stars, by @megansanicki
  - documentation = #1 driver of users
  - protips: 1) target first-time contributors, 2) ensure smooth process, 3) recognition (e.g. in release notes
- Keynote: reproducible ML workflow with Kubernetes pipelines
  - ML history:
    - 1970s: decision trees
    - 1990s: modeling & simulation
    - 2010s: deep learning
    - now: embedded intelligence
  - ML will soon be synonymous with software
  - "lack of ML lifecycle management" (?)
  - ML repo checklist
    - source code & libraries
    - data collection process
    - data pre-processing
    - hyper parameters
    - (?)
    - (?)
  - Kubeflow
    - makes it easier for people to develop, deploy, manage ML clusters
    - handles: development, training, serving, orchestration
    - Kubernetes infrastructure (?)
    - lab: goo.gle/kubeflow
- Keynote: continuous delivery with Kubernetes by @pritianka - event - [PDF slides](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/ossna19/c5/GitLab_Priyanka%20Sharma_Updated.pdf)
  - Gitlab has fully remote employees & uses continuous delivery with Kubernetes
  - continuous delivery = one step for manual deployment to prod (often for legal regulations)
    - vs. continuous deployment = all automated
  - "cycle time compression" = determines winners/losers (?)
  - Gitlab runs on Gitlab, uses Ansible, & does not yet use kubernetes flow for CD
  - focus on legacy first --> less risk (?)
  - commit to canary in 2 hours
    - weekly --> daily deployments
    - all devs in an on-call rotation within 3 weeks
  - culture shift
    - quality is a priority
    - no hot-patching unless PL & SL (?)
    - every engineer is on the on-call rotation
  - advice
    - figure out workflows first
    - no shiny objects (?)
    - decouple infrastructure changes from people changes (?)
- Keynote: living on the edge - computing as the next battleground - event - [PDF slides](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/ossna19/9e/8.%20Arpit%20Joshipura.pdf)
  - emerging edge apps -- fueling lower latency & accelerating processing
    - hardware acceleration
    - AI
    - microservices
  - top 5 edge services
    - non-traditional video (e.g. 360° cameras)
    - things that move (e.g. GPS ?)
    - ?
    - ?
    - ?
  - markets
    - industrial manufacturing
    - energy
    - commerce
    - IOT
    - ?
    - ?

### Keynote: Open Data @ FB

- FB's most well-known open source project: React
- FB's work in connectivity or AI research is also often made available
- FB contributes to the Urban Computing Foundation (with Google, Uber) for (geo) spatial computing
- FB has [disaster maps](https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/disaster-maps/)
  - interested in
    - what areas are affected
    - where are humans evacuating from/to
    - where has power/connectivity been disrupted
    - where have displaced folks settled long-term
  - partners with many first responders
  - to maintain user privacy
    - anonymization / aggregation
    - add random noise
    - spatial smoothing
    - remove small counts
  - 5 types of mapping
    - FB population before/after (red = growing, blue = leaving)
    - movement map = arrows of different thickness
    - displacement map = where people eventually wind up
    - network coverage = estimated by where # people are
    - power availability = inference by # Android devices being charged
- maps @ FB
  - maps are used across Presence, Search, Events, etc.
  - [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) = free, editable map, with contributors from around the world
  - OSM road coverage varies across the world (e.g. Central America, Central Africa, India, China have low coverage)
  - mapping with AI-generated features
    - access to higher-res satellite imagery + advances in deep learning --> drastic improvements in speed
    - [RapiD](https://github.com/facebookincubator/RapiD) map editor tool
    - AI + ground truth = better to have it already digitized so that volunteers can focus on the important stuff (e.g. whether a bridge can be crossed by cars or only by pedestrians)
  - since 2018, all provinces of Thailand have been mapped
  - [blog post 1](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/mapping-roads-through-deep-learning-and-weakly-supervised-training/) • [blog post 2](https://tech.fb.com/ai-is-supercharging-the-creation-of-maps-around-the-world/)

### Crafting Good `good-first-issue`s

- [PDF slides](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/ossna19/de/ossna_2019_good_first_issues.pdf)
- `good-first-issue`s and where to find them
  - other labels like `good-first-issue`
  - up-for-grabs
  - easy-fix
  - low-hanging-fruit
  - beginner-friendly
  - starter-bug
  - jump-in
- Why (take the time to) create `good-first-issue`s?
  - Makes your project approachable
  - Reduces the barriers to contribution - especially for groups underrepresented in Open Source
  - Make contributors interested in your project (potentially)
  - Create maintainable code
  - Take care of the important stuff (coding is the easy part)
  - Work towards growing the project
- How to prepare for creating `good-first-issue`s
  - Plan for accepting a Pull Request
  - README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, NOTICE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT
  - GitHub's Issue Template
  - GitHub's Pull Request Template
  - Getting Started Tutorials
  - Tests - linters, unit tests, functional tests
  - Continuous Integration (Tern uses CircleCI and TravisCI and looking to try GitHub Actions)
- How to create `good-first-issue`s
  - Break a feature down into small tasks
  - Document changes that are needed to complete the task
  - Use stubs
  - Pick changes in the modular part of the code
  -
  -
- `good-first-issue` wins
  - Supporting the contributor; This isn't a technical interview
  - Tracking each `good first issue` to an impactful change
  - Participating in group events
- `good-first-issue` fails
  - Assigning dependent issues to new contributors
    - DO NOT put a new contributor in the critical path
    - Contributors are totally OK with you taking over
    - Contributors are NOT OK with you forcing them to adhere to your schedule
  - Picking a task of unreasonably large scope
  - Poorly documenting a good-first-issue
- Takeaways
  - Fosters a more inclusive community
  - Forces more disciplined code and project management
  - Grows the project and the community sustainably
- Costs:
  - More work up-front
  - More planning than coding
  - Not a steady source of goodfirst-issues
  - Not guaranteed of retaining contributors

### Open Source in Safety-Critical Apps, by `@_kate_steward`

- Margaret Hamilton's code (Apollo on-board flight software) = first code off the planet
  - it had to work the first time
  - software would need to be able to detect an error & recover from it in real time
- Dana Lewis
  - cofounder of OpenAPS, glucose monitor running on Linux on a Raspberry Pi
  - "Automated Insulin Delivery" book
  - #wearenotwaiting
- Agile software dev't = fail fast, fail early
- software development for functional safety = uses "v-model" of development
- users will demand accountability --> who is liable if something goes wrong in open source, safety-critical software?
- is open source compatible with safety standards? yes, BUT
- v-model = requires traceability (?)
