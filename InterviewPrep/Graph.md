# Graphs

## Quick details
- model harder real-world problems than trees
- like in trees, nodes have children
- may contain loops
- node = "vertex"
- line = "edge"
- "directed" = edges point in one direction only
  - e.g. acqueducts connecting cities, assuming water only flows one way
- "undirected" = edges point in both directions
  - e.g. air travel

### Representations
- adjacency list of neighbor nodes
- adjacency matrix = square matrix of `n^2` with element at `i`, `j` representing # edges from `i` to `j`

- BFS / DFS, but watch out for loops
