# Object-Oriented Programming

## Inheritance (Java "extends")
- class B inherits from class A
  - class A is B's __*parent*__ or __*base*__
  - class B is A's __*subclass*__
- all behaviors from class A are present in class B, though possibly modified
- an instance of class B can be used where an instance of class A is required

## Polymorphism
- ability to provide multiple implementations of an action
- e.g. an abstract class Shape with implementations Rectangle, Circle, Triangle
- construction / deconstruction
- __interface__ = declares a set of methods, outside of any class
- __abstract class__ = incomplete class that declares (but does not define) all its methods
